Have you ever had a hard time planning group meetups due to conflicting schedules? Our app tells you your friends' status and finds the most adequate time for your friend group to meet!

About the project:
- App prompts user's calendar via URL
- After user login, they can view their friends' current locations and their status (busy, in class, etc.) on a map interface
- By selecting a group of friends to make a Study Group, the app can aggregate the group's calendars and find the closest time when everyone is available

The process:
- Created the bulk of the project with the React Native platform
- Integrated Google Maps API to allow for map display

This project was created within a 24-hour timeline as part of the NewHacks 2022 hackathon.
